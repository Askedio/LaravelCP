LaravelCP is back once again. This time learning from my past mistakes I will try to provide a better base example.

From day one we will be creating this as a seperate package, utilizing all of Larvels features without editing it directly.

The goal, once again, is for a completly Modular software with different packages you can inject, like our 'l4cp-support' package last year.

Stay tuned on asked.io for tutorials that will go along with the development of this project.

Add to composer.json required
         "askedio/laravelcp": "dev-master"

Register with config/app.php
         Askedio\Laravelcp\Providers\LaravelcpServiceProvider::class,

Test
         php artisan serv

Browse to http://localhost:8000/test


# Publish
        php artisan vendor:publish 
# Migrate
        php artisan migrate
# Seed
        php artisan db:seed 



# Developing notes
I like to develop in vendor, if you don't - who cares? It's a personal prefrence, my goal is to not change Laravel at all, not even the composer.


## Create Migration
php artisan make:migration test --path="vendor\askedio\laravelcp\src\Database\Migrations"

## Migrate
php artisan migrate --path="vendor\askedio\laravelcp\src\Database\Migrations"
